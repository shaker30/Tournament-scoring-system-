from tournament_manager import TournamentManager

# Initialize the Tournament Manager
tournament_manager = TournamentManager()

# Register a team
tournament_manager.register_team("Team A", ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David"])

# Register an individual participant
tournament_manager.register_individual("Zara")

# Add an event
tournament_manager.add_event("Math Quiz", "individual")

# Record a score for an individual in an event
tournament_manager.record_score("Math Quiz", "Zara", 95)

# Calculate and print rankings for an event
rankings = tournament_manager.calculate_rankings("Math Quiz")
print(rankings)
Development and Customization
The Tournament Manager System is designed to be flexible and easily customizable to fit various tournament formats and rules. Developers can extend or modify the system to include additional features such as dynamic team and individual limits, more complex event types, and enhanced ranking algorithms.

Limitations
The current system is designed with fixed limits for the number of teams and individual participants.
It does not support the automatic verification of participant eligibility for events based on team or individual registration status.
Future Enhancements
Dynamic Participant Limits: Allow for configuration of participant limits based on event or tournament needs.
Enhanced Event Types: Support for more complex event types, including multi-stage events and events with specific eligibility criteria.
Improved Ranking Algorithms: Implementation of more sophisticated ranking algorithms to handle ties and other scoring nuances.
